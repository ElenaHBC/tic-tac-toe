Step 6 - Optional Can you think of better strategy for your computer? Let us know your ideas or try to program them directly.

make the pc_move dependend on the player_move somehow:
pc_move = player_move +/- 1
# TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'function' and 'int'

pc_move = user_move +/- 1 - won't work, since user_move is a local variable defined only inside the function
# NameError: name 'user_move' is not defined

function inside a function/ player_move as an argument in pc_move?
def pc_move(board, player_move):
# pc_move() missing 1 required positional argument: 'player_move'
